# Hack Covid-19 Hackathon - Team PPE-Reuze

### What problem(s) are we trying to solve?

The manufacturing and distribution chains for respirators, masks, goggles, gloves, and face shields (non-exhaustive list, collectively known as PPE) are designed for normal healthcare and industrial operations. Moreover, to minimize inventory and warehousing costs, many suppliers, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers of these products have switched to a just-in-time model of equipment procurement rather than stocking up for times of need.

The above factors have led to the systemâ€™s inability to respond to an unpredictable and severe threat, such as the current COVID pandemic, that requires rapid scaling of PPE production. Even if human and capital infrastructure remain intact, without intact supply chains for crucial goods such as PPE, that infrastructure cannot function efficiently (or at all). Undeniable evidence shows that both our national and global PPE supply chains have been overwhelmed by the current catastrophe, and providers and the public do not have enough PPE on hand to protect themselves against this disease.

There are two main approaches to solving this problem - (1) rapidly make and distribute more PPE to areas of need, or (2) reuse existing goods as efficiently as possible. We propose one solution as part of the second approach - PPE Reuze.

To effectively reuse PPE, a user needs three components: (1) a used piece of material, (2) material for cleaning and sterilization, and (3) knowledge of how to process the used piece of material for the next cycle of use. We assume that the user has some form of access to the first two components, and PPE Reuze is a solution that delivers the third - authoritative, evidence-based, and updated knowledge for reusing these scarce resources.

### What does success look like?

User is able to gain authoritative, evidence-based, and updated knowledge to clean and sterilize their PPE in a guided and user-friendly way.
