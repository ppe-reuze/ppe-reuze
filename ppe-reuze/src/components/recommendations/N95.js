					"Dry heating of the mask at 70Â°C for 30 minutes has been suggested as a method of decontamination which can adequately kill virus and preserve the filter integrity for re-use. Recent tests at the NIH utilizing SARS-CoV-2 specifically indicated that this method can be used for two cycles to kill the virus without compromising fit. Research efforts are ongoing to determine optimal parameters (temperature and duration), and this is not yet recommended by the CDC."
